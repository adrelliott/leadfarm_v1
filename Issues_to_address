1. When creating a new record in the local DB that can also exist in Infusionsoft (like contactaction), I didn't want to go to infusion to create the record each time as this will slow things down. However the Primary key needs to be generated somehow, and my worry was that if I did an autoincrement, then eventually this would increment would meet the infusionosft's primary key starting number. So I used timestamps as temporary primary ID until they get changed by the clean_up script that matches infusionsoft with the local database.
